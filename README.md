H2O - an optimized HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (experimental)
===

To run the Fuzzer X, run "python testing.py {seconds} {runs}" in the command line, where seconds = amount of time the code should run in seconds, and runs = number of iterations the code should run for. Note that the number of runs is in 0-indexing, e.g. runs=0 when running the code once.

If "python" does not work, use the "python3" argument instead.
